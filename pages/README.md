 # Personal Portfolio Project

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This project showcases my skills and projects as an aspiring web developer. I built it using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap** to create a clean and responsive design.


## About the Project

This portfolio is a way to present my professional background, skills, and work samples in a visually appealing and accessible way. It includes sections about me, my skills and some general faq about me. My goal with this project is to demonstrate my abilities in front-end development and to have a resource I can continuously update as my skills grow.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and tools were used to build this project:

- **HTML**: For structuring the web content.
